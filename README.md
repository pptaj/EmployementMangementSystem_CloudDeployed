  7. Deploy Application to the instance


4. **Instructions to run unit and/or integration tests.**

    Running Unit Tests:
  - Isolate parts of programs
  - Verify that independent part of programs are working correctly
  - Write a unit test for every case (positive, negative, null, not null, whitespaces, etc.)
  - Run each unit test and make sure that it passes before submitting the code

 Running Integration Tests:
  - Write tests to verify that interaction between multiple components (applications, services, modules, etc.) is working as    expected.
  - Write an integration test for every data exchange between the data base and the application
  - Run each integration test and make sure that it passes before submitting the code
 
5. **Link to TravisCI setup.**
( [https://travis-ci.com/dsouzachr/neu-csye6225-4] )


6. **Domain Name**
neu-csye6225-spring2017-team-8.site

7. **IAM Console Link**
   https://neu-csye6225-spring2017-team-8.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
   
8. **Change in Technology being used**

   - The project was initially designed to use gradle, but has now been changed to use maven
   - Cassandra was chosen to be the NoSQL database in the project, but has been replaced by DynamoDB due to AWS management, 
     disaster recovery, and cost related issues
     
9. **Progress in the application**
   - Added functionalities such as 
   * Session Handling
   * Leave Management
   * Status Update
   * Task Assignment
   * KPI (Key Performance Inidcator)
   
10. **Shell Scripts**
    - Added Shell Scripts 
    - setups3,websecurity group, dbsecurity group,launchec2instance,mysqlrdsinstance,createdynamo Table
    - Worked on test cases, DynamoDB connectionn and UI of the application

11. **Editing the git config file**
- $ git config --list --local
- $ git config --local --edit

12. **Test Cases**
- Test cases written for Person (Checking if person exists in the Database - Valid or Invalid entry)
- Test cases written for Leaves (Checking if entry is valid or invalid)
- Test cases written for Tasks (Checking if entry is valid or invalid)

13. **File Storage**
- Pdfs are uploaded to S3 with employee feedbacks
- Employees can view their feedback from S3

14. **Penetration Testing and Vector attacks**
- SQL Map: sqlmap is an open source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws   and taking over of database servers
- Kali Linux penetration testing tools
- Wireshark: worldâ€™s foremost and widely-used network protocol analyzer
- We plan on using Grabber, XSS and Wapiti as well
